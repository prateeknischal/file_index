## File Index

File indexer is a simple tools to search files in a specific folder. This is most suited for **static** directories as it does not monitor for changes and if the directory has some changes then it must be re-indexed using the ```--force``` option, or if not then the script asks for forcing index.

It indexes files and stores them into a text file and a dump file generated by pickling the data structure used to store the indexes. The temp files are generated in the project root.

When the script is run, It indexes and creates a server and listens at ```localhost:10250``` by default. It accepts queries in the form of GET url

currently only 2 parameters are accepted    
 * "**fname**", the filename and 
 * "**ext**" the extension of the file.

The script does not search for similar or partially matching filenames but It looks for logical names that a file may have. eg:

```Actual file name : JavaFXVideoPlayerLaunchedFromSwing.java```   
It can identify this file as : ```[java, fx, video, player, launched, from, swing]```  
and all combinations of the names in the list, eg : JavaPlayer.

The name search is NOT case sensitive but to obtain combination of search terms like "JavaPlayer" it must has camel casing (that is what allows segmentation of words).

```
usage: app.py [-h] [-f] [-i] src

positional arguments:
  src          The root dir for crawl

optional arguments:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  -f, --force  Force the crawler to index pre-indexed paths
  -i, --index  Force the crawler to just build a text based list for archiving
               the file list
```
##### Querying :
A simple GET request is sufficient for querying.
e.g.

$ curl "http://localhost:10250/?fname=java&type=java"

##### Response :
```
c:\users\prateek\desktop\projects\JavaFXVideoPlayerLaunchedFromSwing.java
c:\users\prateek\desktop\projects\JavaDemo.java
```

The response is in plaintext.

same can be done using any browser.
